    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hash browns recipe fries shredded potato in clarified butter for diner-style hash browns that are crispy on
        the outside and fluffy on the inside.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is
            cloudy; drain and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain
            potatoes well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture. </li>
        <li>Heat clarified butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle
            shredded potatoes into hot butter in an even layer; season with cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and black
            pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5
            minutes. Flip or stir and continue to cook until potatoes are browned and crusty all over, about 5 more
            minutes. </li>

    </ol>
